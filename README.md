# FlightApp ✈️

A personal iOS flight tracking app built with SwiftUI and FlightAware's AeroAPI.

## About

FlightApp started as a passion project combining my love for travel and curiosity around data. I wanted to create something that could use available real-world flight data and present it in an interface designed using feedback I'd have for another app.

This project serves multiple learning goals:
- **iOS Development**: Hands-on experience with Swift/SwiftUI and industry-grade APIs
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Exploring how AI tools can accelerate prototype development and code refinement
- **Industry API Integration**: Working with FlightAware's AeroAPI to understand real-world data patterns
- **App Store Connect**: Taking a project from concept to App Store submission solo
- **Prioritization**: Working on prioritzing what's important so the product can get into people's hands asap

*Note: This is a snapshot-in-time personal project. Features and functionality may evolve or change over time as I continue learning and experimenting.*

## Features

- **Real-time Flight Tracking**: Live flight status, departure/arrival times, and progress tracking
- **Interactive Route Maps**: Visual flight paths with waypoints using MapKit
- **Comprehensive Flight Details**: Aircraft information, airports, delays, and more
- **Route Visualization**: Enhanced mapping with VOR/DME/NDB navigation points

## Technical Stack

- **iOS**: SwiftUI, MapKit, Combine
- **API**: FlightAware AeroAPI for real-time flight data
- **Data**: Navigation database with international waypoints
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with async/await
- **Development**: Claude was used as a peer in building this

## Current Status

**Version 0.1.0** (Release Candidate)

✅ Core flight tracking functionality  
✅ Route visualization with waypoint mapping  
✅ Enhanced UI with status indicators  
✅ Comprehensive navigation database  
⚠️ International route mapping (limited coverage in some regions)

*This represents the current state of the project. Future updates and maintenance will depend on available time and evolving interests.*

## Development Philosophy

This project represents an exploration of modern development workflows, particularly the role of AI in rapid prototyping and iteration. The goal was to see how quickly a functional, polished app could be built by combining domain knowledge, AI assistance, and traditional development practices.

### Key Learnings

- Working with real-time aviation data and industry APIs
- MapKit integration and custom geospatial visualization
- SwiftUI state management and async operations
- AI-assisted debugging and feature development
- Asset management and App Store Connect process

## Privacy & Terms

FlightApp respects user privacy and only collects necessary flight data for functionality. See [Privacy Policy](Privacy%20Policy.md) and [Terms and Conditions](Terms%20and%20Conditions.md) for details.
